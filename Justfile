# The wave is what is ready and not yet spawned: `keeler-graph`'s ready
# tasks minus the ones `keeler-status` already knows — running, died,
# passed or failed but not landed — and this recipe computes neither. It
# owns no logic those two have; it reads them and prints one line per task
# in the spec's order: the graph's own line for a task that is done, ready
# or blocked (with what it waits on), the board's own line for a ready task
# already spawned. Then it names the wave and asks. `_spawn-preflight`
# runs first, so a checkout keeler-spawn would refuse is refused here in
# the same words, before any wave is printed.
#
# The yes is read from stdin — a human at a terminal is asked in the
# ordinary way, and a test pipes its answer — and it is `yes` or `y`, case
# aside, and nothing else. When there is nobody to ask, the recipe refuses
# and names KEELER_FAN_OUT_YES rather than hanging or exiting in silence:
# `read` at EOF under `set -e` would end the recipe with a bare 1, and a
# pipe nobody closes would hang it, so a stdin that is not a terminal gets
# a bounded read — an answer piped in advance is there at once; nothing
# within the wait is nobody. `KEELER_FAN_OUT_YES=1` answers yes without
# asking, for the caller who has already decided. It is the zero-yes path
# this recipe otherwise refuses, so no command file may set it, and a
# test says so.
#
# On the yes, the wave is handed to `keeler-spawn` one task at a time, in
# the order it was printed in — the same recipe a hand would run, so every
# refusal it has fires per task and nothing here cuts a worktree of its
# own. A refusal is that task's alone: the board was read a moment before,
# and a task another hand has spawned since is named and stepped over
# while the rest of the wave spawns. The run reports what spawned and what
# did not, and exits non-zero when anything was refused — one wave, one
# yes, one exit code that says whether it all went out.
#
# Then the wave is shown as one thing: a detached session
# keeler-<spec-slug>-wave holding a pane per run, each attached to that
# run's own session, tiled as they are added. The per-task sessions are
# the source of truth and outlive the view — the board reads them,
# `tmux attach` on one still works, closing the view kills nothing — so a
# view that cannot be built is reported and leaves the exit code alone.
